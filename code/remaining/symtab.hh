Parameters require particular checking, as the formal parameters are to

\verbatim embed:rst

::

  procedure p(i : integer; r : real);

which is then called with the following actual parameters:

::

  p(22/7, 355/113);

To perform a semantic check, we must find the formal parameters (``i``
and ``r``) in the symbol table and compare their type attributes with
the actual parameters. In this example a type conflict occurs when the
value of the expression ``22/7`` (which is a ``real``) is to be
bound to the ``integer`` variable ``i``.

For this reason the formal parameters are linked together in the symbol
table. The ``preceding`` attribute points to the previous parameter in
the link chain. The procedure (or function) points to the ``last``
parameter. It might seem counter-intuitive that the parameters are
stored backwards like this, but it will actually make life easier later
on.

The handling of parameters is actually one of the trickiest parts to
understand correctly in this entire lab course. Some work has already
been done for you, but you will have to do a lot of it yourself. Make
sure to read the code comments carefully when dealing with parameters,
and be sure to have this lab material handy as well. The order of the
parameters will be flipped around during compiling more than once. Once
you have that sequence clear, getting them to work will be a lot easier.

    /*! \brief Installs a symbol in the symbol table and returns its index.
      This method installs a symbol in the symbol table and returns its
      index. If the symbol already existed at the same lexical level
      (i.e. two objects with the same identifi and value of the
      attribute level), the object will not be installed, and the index
      of the symbol that already exists is returned.

      If a symbol is installed, its tag will be set to ``::SYM_UNDEF``
      (which is done by default in the symbol constructor). The
      appropriate tag will then be set in the ``enter_`` method that
      called ``symbol_table::install_symbol``. In this way name collisions can be
      discovered. For instance: The variable ``m`` is declared twice on
      the same lexical level, and that is of course not correct. When the
      first ``m`` is encountered the method ``symbol_table::enter_variable`` will try to
      install the symbol in the symbol table. It calls ``symbol_table::install_symbol``
      which creates and install a symbol of the correct type. The symbol’s
      tag is now set to ``::SYM_UNDEF``. When ``symbol_table::install_symbol`` finishes,
      the execution continues inside ``symbol_table::enter_variable`` and the method
      checks if the recent installed symbol’s tag is set to ``::SYM_UNDEF``,
      and if it’s true, it changes the tag to ``::SYM_VAR``. When the second
      ``m`` is encountered the procedure is repeated, but this time
      ``symbol_table::install_symbol`` returns the ``::sym_index`` to the first ``m``.
      When checking the tag of this symbol, ``symbol_table::enter_variable`` gets the
      answer ``::SYM_VAR`` and not ``::SYM_UNDEF``. Therefore
      ``symbol_table::enter_variable`` knows that a symbol with this name already exists
      in the symbol table at this lexical level and outputs an error
      message. The second ``m`` is never installed. Furthermore, the level
      attribute will be set to the current lexical level,
      ``symbol_table#current_level`` (which is currently zero).

      Note that the first argument to ``symbol_table::install_symbol`` is an index to
      the string table (``symbol_table#string_pool``). This is, of course, what the
      scanner outputs in the ``YYSTYPE::pool_p`` field of the ``::yylval`` union. If
      you had problems understanding what it was for earlier, hopefully
      some of that has become more clear now!

      The second argument is the tag that the symbol should have, it
      denotes which symbol class should be used (``constant_symbol``,
      ``variable_symbol``, etc.).
